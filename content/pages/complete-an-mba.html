    <article class="post-body">
        <p class="introduction">I class myself as a maker. I love creating things. In my daily life, this means making software, but outside of work I like anything which results in creating something new.</p>
        <p>As time passed, I realised that making larger things needed more organisation and other skills besides a creative spirit. Organising people and finance for a project is rarely easy. Neither is finding a market and planning a business strategy.</p>
        <p>But the result is the same: something new is created.</p>
        <p>After speaking to a colleague, I realised that an MBA might provide me with more education and knowledge of the business that surrounds projects.</p>
        <h2>The Open University MBA</h2>
        <p>I didn’t want to take time out of work to do the MBA. Some universities provided part-time lectures, some weekend-based and some evenings. <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University flexible MBA course</a> takes the approach that students can study in their own time. Students allocated to tutor groups of about 16 students who are encouraged to meetup face-to-face and online. Each year there’s a short residential school where people work together on live case studies and attend workshops.</p>
        <p>I found this approach suited me better as I’m used to studying in my own time. I could study in the evenings and weekends and attend tutor group meetups as and when they happened.</p>
        <h2>Course Syllabus</h2>
        <p>The course is 3-years’ part-time study. The first year consists of compulsory modules while years 2 and 3 have elective modules which you can choose.</p>

        <h2>My Chosen Electives</h2>
        <p>For my elective modules I chose to study marketing, financial risk and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Working in a development department often gives an element of protection from the wider financial risk a company faces. I chose to study risk because I believed that understanding it better would help to find ways product design could help minimise that risk.</p>
        <p>I also find brands and how customers relate to businesses and the products they sell interesting, so I chose this as an elective. It would give me a better picture of the context that development operates in.</p>
        <p>Finally, I chose to study entrepreneurship because of the rising startup culture that accompanies the digital age. I believed that we could take advantage of partnerships if the company had a better understanding of the issues and challenges facing entrepreneurs and startups.</p>

        <h2>Completion</h2>
        <p>The course is set to complete in 2019, but I set my goal as 2020 to give some room in case of unforeseen circumstances.</p>
        <p>I aim to hit the original completion date.</p>
