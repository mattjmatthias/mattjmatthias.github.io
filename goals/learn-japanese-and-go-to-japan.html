    <article class="post-body">
        <p class="introduction">If there’s a country known for being different, it’s Japan.</p>
        <p>A quick search on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Japan+is+weird">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/#q=why+is+japan+different">Google</a> shows the variation of culture that exists. As an island nation, at times closed, its culture has developed in isolation giving it a unique perspective.</p>
        <p>This difference has not only created a culture full of diversity but also a language full of difference.</p>
        <p>If <a href="/learning-mandarin">learning Mandarin</a> is like committing to a religion, learning Japanese is like applying to be a priest and run the monastery. It takes devotion, passion, and maybe a little naivety.</p>
        <h2>A Different Language</h2>
        <p>Japanese grammar could not be more different from English. It’s like someone set about creating a language with ‘being different’ as the main aim. It makes European languages seem like accents and dialects of the same language.</p>
        <p>It uses Chinese characters as its writing system. This alone makes it a gruelling language to tackle. The Japanese, being the Japanese, decided to create 2 additional alphabets from Chinese characters: one for foreign words, and one to help make the spoken language fit Chinese characters.</p>
        <p>Most characters have multiple ways of being read: one based on the reading in Chinese, and one or two more based on the original Japanese word. (Chinese, in comparison, has one reading per character!)</p>
        <p>It has</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No articles, definite or indefinite (the, these, those, a, an)</li>
            <li>The subject is often inferred in speech</li>
            <li>An explicit and extensive use of transitive and intransitive verbs</li>
            <li>A constant awareness of state</li>
            <li>A use of nouns and adjectives that blur the categories used in most other languages</li>
            <li>Verb forms that express social standing</li>
            <li>Verb forms, nouns and expressions that reflect masculinity or directness</li>
            <li>Auxiliary verbs which convey a host of subtle emotional meanings such as respect for others, willingness to try</li>
            <li>A built-in awareness of social groups</li>
            <li>Widespread use of endings to conjugate verbs, adjectives and nearly everything else</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>An Example For An English Speaker</h2>
        <p>So, compared to learning French, where you build up a list of word-to-word translations that mostly work, Japanese is horrendous.</p>
        <p>Most English expressions directly translated (if that’s even possible, and it generally isn’t) aren’t even said in the same way.</p>
        <p>As a simple example</p>
        <p><em>The window is open</em></p>
        <p>Directly (and incorrectly) translated would be</p>
        <p>窓は開けです - <em>mado wa ake desu (window the open is)</em></p>
        <p>The Japanese says this as</p>
        <p>窓は開けている - <em>mado wa akete iru [window was opened and still is]</em></p>
        <p>Times this by a thousand and you can understand how learning Japanese takes a lot of memorisation.</p>
        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p>I decided I wanted to learn Japanese in my early 20s and considered going. I didn’t start planning until I was 30, so I started to learn Japanese.</p>
        <p>Adult life got in the way and I instead bought a house.</p>
        <p>6 years later, and a fair amount of Japanese under my belt and a decent grasp of some Japanese writing, I finally arranged to go.</p>
        <p>I went in April 2016 and the holiday more than lived up to what I expected. I used my Japanese wherever I could, learned more characters by being surrounded by them and was told not to use certain forms because it made me sound like a girl.</p>
        <p>I’m working to become more fluent in Japanese. It’s one of those things you spend your life doing.</p>
        <p>I’m sure I’ll go back one day to try again, but for this goal, it’s completed.</p>
